# MarkkuTheLoader
 Markku is written in **C++** with object-oriented style. For this project **OpenGL** is used to provide graphics. For build process I use **premake5**. Other 3rd-party libraries/headers I used: **glfw, glad, ImGui, glm, assimp, stb_image, spdlog**.
At the moment (V1) only .obj files are tested and thus supported. Also only one diffuse and specular map is supported. Texture files and a .mtl file must be in the same directory as the actual object file.
